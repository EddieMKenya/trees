# TPPF
Trees for Planet, Profit, and Future (TPPF) is a community-driven initiative with one bold goal: to plant one million fruit trees across Kenya by 2025. This project will restore degraded lands, sequester thousands of tonnes of CO₂, and create sustainable livelihoods for women and youth, all while improving food security and biodiversity.
